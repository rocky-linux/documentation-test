# Markdown demo V3

This document is for testing of Transiflex to check the document lifecycle and what happens when things are translated and then changed.

## Code

In any testing document it is a good idea to have some code to test with as well. This code is meaningless, however, so don't use it:


```
dnf install senseofhumor
dnf enable laughter
```

## Admonition

Just like other conditions, testing formatting for results is a good idea too. Here we are testing with an admonition.

!!! warning "This is dangerous!"

    Using admonitions is not required, but can be helpful to draw attention to certain things in your docuument. Take care to use admonitions only when necessary.

## Tables

Let us also test a table:

| table     | description                  |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| 1st item  | the 1st item description     |
| 2nd item  | the 2nd item description     |
| 3rd item  | the 3rd item description     |


## Conclusions

This is designed to help check the Transiflex interface and make sure that changes in the source will properly change the translation file without scrambling the content on future iterations.
